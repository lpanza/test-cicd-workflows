In order for subscriptions to PolicyGenerator to work, you need to add the user to the right clusterrolebinding

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.7/html/applications/managing-applications#granting-subscription-admin-privilege

E.G.:
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: open-cluster-management:subscription-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: open-cluster-management:subscription-admin
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: system:admin
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: kube:admin

Then, you need to allow the Policy object tipe in the sub:

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.7/html/applications/managing-applications#creating-allow-deny-list

E.G.:

---
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  [...]
spec:
  allow:
    - apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
      kinds:
        - Policy
        - PlacementBinding
    - apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
      kinds:
        - PlacementRule
